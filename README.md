## factfully: 
61% of Americans donâ€™t trust that they can successfully tell fake news from legitimate stories online; meanwhile, political entities around the world are spending a collective $78 billion disseminating it, and social media companies are largely turning a blind eye. 
Factfully is a modern anti-misinformation tool, installable onto browsers, which employs a set of heuristic algorithms to combat fake news online. 
It takes a three-pronged approach: 
1. it puts disclaimers over potentially false ads,
2. warns users after detecting potentially misleading sponsored posts on social media, and
3. highlights any potentially false claims in an article the user is reading.

TODO: 
- get adblocker more effective
- change from highlight and fact-check to automatic fact checking
- use extension window to give reliability score on the current website
- start work on social media tool
